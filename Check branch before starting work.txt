Check branch before starting work

git branch --show-current


If it says develop, good.

Create feature branches (optional but clean)

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-change


Do your coding here.

When done → merge into develop locally

git checkout develop
git merge feature/my-change
git push origin develop


→ This deploys to your dev server automatically.

After testing on dev server → merge into main

git checkout main
git pull origin main   # update main
git merge develop
git push origin main


→ This deploys to your prod server automatically.

Go back to develop to keep building

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop


Repeat cycle.
